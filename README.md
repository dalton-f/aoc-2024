# Advent of Code 2024

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2024 repository! ðŸŽ„

This markdown file will serve as a log to track my progress, thoughts, and solutions throughout the event.

Please note: none of these solutions should be considered correct, or even optimal, they are just simply what I can come up with

## Days

### Day 1:

I found today relatively simple. The input parsing was the most "tricky" part but this felt like a very standard Day 1 problem.

### Day 2:

I struggled with part 2 of this problem, until refactoring the code to be more modualar. I do not believe brute-forcing the solution is the best solution, but I cannot think of anything better

### Day 3:

Easiest day so far, could have used regex but glad I found a more intuitive solution that I can understand - part 2 required very little changes to the code

### Day 4:

Relatively simple problem, I found part 2 much easier than part 1 due to the way I solved it, very much spaghetti code to traverse the array both vertically and diagonally. Could easily be compacted down to one loop. I like how simple my part 2 code is after struggling to land on the right solution for a while due to weird out of bound errors.
