# 2024 Advent of Code Solutions - JavaScript

I chose to participate in this challenge again using JavaScript instead of having ambitious goals of using a langauge I am not familiar with.

All of the days will have both part 1 and 2 solutions, with the task.md and a given input.

These are by no means the most optimal solutions, just the way I intuitively solve them so that I can look back on it over the years.
